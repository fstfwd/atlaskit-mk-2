## MediaPicker

#### 15.0.0 (2017-12-05)
 * **breaking:**
    * Renamed public event payload types and interfaces to be consistant with internal event types
      * If you have previously used these types, you will need to switch to the newly renamed types
      * e.g. UploadsStartPayload to UploadsStartEventPayload
    * Tightened the allowable events listenable by component type
      * e.g. you can no longer listen to Popup specific events from non-popup components

#### 14.1.0 (2017-12-05)
 * **minor:**
    * Various code quality improvements. Cleanup work after popup iframe removal.
    * Using AK colors and fonts remove upload section
    * Display different files with different icons in remove upload section.

#### 12.0.0 (2017-11-21)

#### 11.1.9 (2017-11-17)

  * **patch**
    * Disables cloud picking (Dropbox and Google Drive) when Popup is embedded within the Stride Electron app
      * Popup internally checks the `navigator.userAgent` to see whether it starts with "Stride" to determine whether to disable cloud picking
    * Fixes race condition with Media Picker Popup `teardown()` and `init()`
      * Previously, if consumers were to call init() after a teardown() some of the required setup config for Popup would be missing from the iframes url query string

          * from: `<Blob | undefined>`
          * to: `<ImagePreview> {width:number, height:number, src:string}`
      * This event is no longer sent if image preview fails, therefore payload will always contain image details if preview successfully generated
